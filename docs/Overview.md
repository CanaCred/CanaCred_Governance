# Canadian Credential Network

The Canadian Credential Network (CanaCred) is a group of volunteers who believe that a Canadian network for identity credentials will best serve Canadian citizens, businesses, government and academic institutions. Until a global trusted network can be put together, we need to launch a Canadian-focused network as the most secure and equitable way to move forward.

The members of CanaCred represent a group of volunteers striving to create and promote a credential network hosted-in-Canada.  CanaCred serves the purpose of raising, budgeting and spending funds in support of the Network, the Registries and the CanaCred Wallet.  

CanaCred is intended to serve organizations that desire to participate in digital trust ecosystems and require a governance framework that will strive to follow the principles of SSI and and leverage guiding principles introduced by the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework:

* Support robust, secure, scalable solutions
* Implement, protect, and enhance privacy by design
* Be inclusive, open, and meet broad stakeholder needs
* Provide Canadians with choice, control, and convenience
* Build on open standards-based protocols
* Minimize data transfer between sources and avoid creation of new or expanded identity information repositories
* Be transparent in governance and operation

To meet these requirements, the Canacred Network operates pursuant to its own governance framework.  Network members can participate at several levels in providing supporting infrastructure to maintain a sustainable permissioned identity utility that is structured as an enterprise safe-space and purpose built as a trusted ecosystem for verifiable credentials. The Network operates as an independent Network Service Provider that administers a freely accessible network for the delivery of a DID Ledger.
